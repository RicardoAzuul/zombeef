# Basic concept

Big agriculture has been experimenting with increasing meat production of cows.
This has led to mutations: cows have turned into zombies, and their bite can turn people into zombies too.
Some cows have even mutated further, into weird zombie cow monstrosities.

# Hook

News articles have popped up about a strange infection in a small town. People became violent, biting and scratching before having to be shot by the people they attacked or the police.
It is suggested to be a form of rabies or perhaps some new drug, and these people are jokingly referred to as "zombies".
What's going on:
Big agriculture has been experimenting on cows. One such experiment is in the town of [bla]. The corporation has created a super zombie cow - Lisa -  that regrows flesh. The corporation has been distributing this flesh to the populace, unknown to everyone.
It's good beef, but has the nasty side effect of zombifying the consumer.
Lisa is being kept locked away, with occassionally meat cut off and processed. She is going crazy and wants to break out.

# The Threats

## Monster

Description

Monster type and motivation
- Beast (motivation: to run wild, destroying and killing)
- Breeder (motivation: to give birth to, bring forth, or create
evil)
- Collector (motivation: to steal specific sorts of things)
- Destroyer (motivation: to bring about the end of the world)
- Devourer (motivation: to consume people)
- Executioner (motivation: to punish the guilty)
- Parasite (motivation: to infest, control and devour)
- Queen (motivation: to possess and control)
- Sorcerer (motivation: to usurp unnatural power)
- Tempter (motivation: to tempt people into evil deeds)
- Torturer (motivation: to hurt and terrify)
- Trickster (motivation: to create chaos)

For this first mystery we have a Beast - motivation: to run wild, destroying and killing - in the form of Lisa, a mutated zombie cow which can spit cud that acts like glue and can incapacitate creatures. Unlike most zombies and zombie cows, Lisa is not mindless: there is a terrible intelligence behind those dead eyes. She knows she's been changed, hurt, and she wants payback. She's also being held.

Supernatural powers

Lisa spits cud that acts like glue, she uses this to build a nest and to imprison people.

Being the mother of the zombies and zombie cows, she can control them.

Attacks and armour

Bite: 2-harm hand, infection. Roll tough. On a 10+ you are ok, for now. On a 7 to 9, the infection begins, take -1 forward. On a 6-, the infection is rampant, take -1 ongoing.
Kick: 3-harm hand, forceful

Armour 1: Lisa is a cow and a zombie

How much harm will kill it

8 harm

Weaknesses

Being shot in the head, though she will not let this happen easily.

Custom moves (optional)

## Minions

Decide if the monster is working on its own or if it has minions to help
it. If it has minions, detail them now. Minions can be weaker individuals of the same kind of monster, allied creatures of different kinds,
human worshippers, or human (perhaps unwitting) servants.
Minions need the following details:
• A description.
• Minion type and motivation.
• Supernatural powers, if any.
• Attacks and armour.
• How much harm will kill it.
• A weakness (optional).
• Custom moves for powers (optional).
There are ten minion types:
• Assassin (motivation: to kill the hunters)
• Brute (motivation: to intimidate and attack)
• Cultist (motivation: to save their own skin at any cost)
• Guardian (motivation: to bar a way or protect something)
• Right hand (motivation: to back up the monster)
• Plague (motivation: to swarm and destroy)
• Renfield (motivation: to push victims towards the monster)
• Scout (motivation: to stalk, watch, and report)
• Thief (motivation: to steal and deliver to the monster)
• Traitor (motivation: to betray people)
Minions may have powers and weaknesses like a monster. They are
usually weaker, but otherwise you can follow the rules and guidelines
for monster powers and weaknesses.
Define attacks, harm capacity, and armour for all minions.
Minion attacks should be in the 1- to 4- harm range. The amount of
harm required to kill the minion should range from 5 to 10 (although
weaker and stronger minions are both possible).
A group of minions can be defined the same as an individual. Do
this if the minions are a gang or swarm of nameless goons or critters,
to keep things simple. Define their attacks, armour, and harm capacity
to account for the group as a whole. A group of minions should have
their attacks boosted by one to represent their multiple attacks. The
group can be given a single harm track for all of the minions: harm
taken represents defeat of the group as a whole.
If minions have armour, they normally have 1-armour, and only
rarely 2-armour or higher.

Zombies: Plague (motivation: to swarm and destroy)

Zombie cows: Scout (motivation: to stalk, watch, and report)

The corporate shill: Guardian (motivation: to bar a way or protect something)

## Bystanders

Bystanders are the normal people who are involved in the situation.
They’re the victims, witnesses, interfering cops, and anyone else.
Each bystander needs the following details:
• A name.
• A description.
• A bystander type and motivation.
There are nine types of bystander:
• Busybody (motivation: to interfere in other people’s plans)
• Detective (motivation: to rule out explanations)
• Gossip (motivation: to pass on rumours)
• Helper (motivation: to join the hunt)
• Innocent (motivation: to do the right thing)
• Official (motivation: to be suspicious)
• Skeptic (motivation: to deny supernatural explanations)
• Victim (motivation: to put themselves in danger)
• Witness (motivation: to reveal information)
Include at least two bystanders: it’s important to have some people for
the hunters to save.
Start by defining the people directly involved in the situation: surviving victims, witnesses, official investigators. Think about why they
are here, why they’re involved in the monster’s plan, and what they
want to achieve. Coming up with those details helps develop them as
real people, in a real world.
142THE KEEPER
You generally don’t need to worry about how much harm a
bystander can take (it will almost always be seven, the same as a
hunter) or what their weapons are. If a bystander has a good chance
of getting involved in a fight (helpers in particular might do this), note
down what they’re armed with.
It’s a good idea to include some partially defined bystanders: just
a name and type. You can use them in play for unexpected bystander
characters: just add any extra details at the time.

The farmer: Victim

The farmer's wife: Innocent

The farmhand: Gossip

The local sheriff: Skeptic

A reporter: detective

The local doctor: Witness

Survivors from the fight at the fast food place
## Locations

The farm

The fast food place

The secret lab at the farm: Lab



Locations are places that can cause trouble for the hunters. They’re
metaphorically hostile, encompassing all the stuff that can go wrong
around the hunters (like the phones not working, or a car not starting,
or getting lost and ending up alone in the dark).
Locations need the following details:
• A name.
• A description.
• Location type and motivation.
• Optionally, a map.
• Optionally, one or more custom moves.
There are ten location types:
• Crossroads (motivation: to bring people, and things, together)
• Deathtrap (motivation: to harm intruders)
• Den (motivation: to harbor monsters)
• Fortress (motivation: to deny entry)
• Hellgate (motivation: to create evil)
• Hub (motivation: to reveal information)
• Lab (motivation: to create weirdness)
• Maze (motivation: to confuse and separate)
• Prison (motivation: to constrain and prevent exit)
• Wilds (motivation: to contain hidden things)
Define a location for anywhere that you expect significant parts of the
mystery will take place. Anywhere that is going to be an important
scene of investigation or action, or where the monster is active should
be written up as a location threat.
Good locations to start with are:
• The general area.
• The monster’s lair.
• Places where the monster has been active, or attacked
someone.
• Places that the bystanders will be found.
Maps can help define the location so that everyone can see how it
looks. Even a quick sketch of the area can help the group picture
what’s going on and what the place is like. Another good source for
town or region maps is to find an appropriate looking place in Google
Maps and print it out.

Countdown:
Each mystery has a countdown: this is the sequence of terrible things
that will happen if the hunters don’t stop the monster. The countdown
will be your guide to what will be going on off-screen as the hunters
investigate.
To create the countdown, think about what would happen if the
hunters never came to help.
• Who would be attacked?
• Who would die?
• What is the monster’s ultimate plan?
Once you have an idea, divide it into six events in the order they will
occur. Then allocate them to the steps in the countdown. Countdowns
always have the following six steps:
• Day.
• Shadows.
• Dusk.
• Sunset.
• Nightfall.
• Midnight.
The names of each step are intended to give a sense of things
getting worse. They are metaphorical: the “sunset” step of a countdown doesn’t have to happen at sunset; the steps don’t have to happen
on the same day.
As the countdown is what would happen if the hunters didn’t
interfere, it normally won’t play out how you wrote it. But even when
the monster’s plan has been derailed, it will still be trying to achieve
its goals and the countdown is useful as a guide (or something to
adapt) to determine what happens next.

What happens if the hunters do nothing?
- More people are turned into zombies
- These zombies try and make it back to the farm to turn cows into zombies.
- The zombie cows go after the corporate agent
- Once the corporate agent is turned, Lisa can be freed and she sends her zombies and zombie cows to infect the village.
- Once the village is overrun, the military intervenes, but black ops style. The corporation has too much money and influence.

- Day: there is a minor outbreak of zombies at a local fast food place. Though it's reported as a fight.
- Shadows: Lisa turns the other cows at the farm into zombie cows.
- Dusk: Lisa sends her zombie cows after the corporate shill.
- Sunset: Lisa sends her zombie cows out to conquer the town.
- Nghtfall: the town is overrun. Lisa has broken free, and people are turned to zombies at an alarming rate. 
- Midnight: The army is called in to deal with the zombies and zombie cows and the town is effectively erased from the map. It's all hush hush.
