# Basic concept

Big agriculture has been experimenting with increasing meat production of cows.
This has led to mutations: cows have turned into zombies, and their bite can turn people into zombies too.
Some cows have even mutated further, into weird zombie cow monstrosities.

# Hook

News articles have popped up about a strange infection in a small town. People became violent, biting and scratching before having to be shot by the people they attacked or the police.
It is suggested to be a form of rabies or perhaps some new drug, and these people are jokingly referred to as "zombies".

For this first mystery we have a Torturer - motivation: to hurt and terrify - in the form of Lisa, a mutated zombie cow which can spit cud that acts like glue and can incapacitate creatures. Unlike most zombies and zombie cows, Lisa is not mindless: there is a terrible intelligence behind those dead eyes. She knows she's been changed, hurt, and she wants payback.
